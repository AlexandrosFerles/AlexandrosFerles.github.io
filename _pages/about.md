Welcome to my personal page!

I am a Research Engineer with the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439) of KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm Sweden.
My focus is on deep neural networks, with applications on image recognition in dermatology and out-of-distribution detection on fine-grained visual recognition tasks.
