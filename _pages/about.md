Welcome!

I am a Research Engineer with the [Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning](https://www.kth.se/rpl/division-of-robotics-perception-and-learning-1.779439) of [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se) in Stockholm, Sweden.
My focus is on deep neural networks, with applications on image recognition in dermatology and out-of-distribution detection on fine-grained visual recognition tasks.

I hold a 5-year (joint B.Eng and M.Eng) diploma from the school of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) and a MSc degree in [Machine Learning](https://www.kth.se/en/studies/master/machinelearning/description-1.48533) from KTH.
